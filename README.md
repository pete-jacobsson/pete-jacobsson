- 👋 Hi, I’m @pete-jacobsson
- 👀 I’m interested in: Research/Monitoring design and prototyping.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: MS Power suite & Quarto blogging.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on process monitoring projects, research design for more complicate data projects, or anything that may be fun and where I might contribute!
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pt-jacobsson/

I used to be an archaeologist, but then I read too much philosophy, theory and anthropology, which lead me to focus on issues of research design in archaeology (and the data analysis wormhole). I ended up doing a PhD on Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates (with a focus on – you guessed – research design), followed by a couple postdocs, which touched a bit more on data audits.  

Then a pandemic hit, and I became a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) Specialist at the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow – arguably the best COVID screening lab in the UK. I hoped to pick up some data engineering in that job, and maybe build a Bayesian process monitoring system – alas – they made me acting Data Lead. 

I am now back on the free market, getting my brain up to scratch, stretching my code fingers, and looking for the next project. If you have a cool data analytics, or process monitoring project on the go (or are looking for a Data Analyst who has a track record of enjoying emergency conditions) - do reach out!
